###  Releasing non-breaking WASI versions (vote on release cadence)

**Bailey Hayes** Yosh Wuyts has given a series of presentations to this subgroup on how we can release non-breaking WASI versions for 0.2. He is not able to be here today so I will be presenting. This is something Yosh has collaborated with several folks to find the right balance of features proposal champions are seeking to make as well as facilitate consensus with the right amount of process. Thank you Alex, Dan, Pat, Luke, and likely others that Yosh collaborated with to create this proposal today.

 **Bailey Hayes** Last meeting, Yosh proposed that amendments to existing proposals begin at phase 2 behind an @unstable gate.

**Bailey Hayes** For past presentations, see: https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/wasi/2024/presentations/2024-05-30-yosh-wuyts-leveraging-since-unstable-gates-in-wasi.pdf and https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/wasi/2024/presentations/2024-06-13-yosh-wuyts-progressing-proposal-changes-through-the-phase-process.pdf

Purpose:
Fixing bugs
Adding new worlds
Evolving existing worlds
Updating documentation

A new WASI patch should be released every 2 months, targeting Aug 1 for the first.
WASI 0.3.0 is intentionally out of this scope. This applies only to additive, non-breaking changes.

Proposed cadence example:
8/1/2024 WASI 0.2.1 is released
9/5/2024 Timezones is voted to progress to phase 3
10/1/2024 WASI 0.2.2 is released with timezones.

If there are patch releases with no features, they will still be released, but that may indicate we should release less often.

This is an alternative to feature-based releases which are individually voted on and released. This is not recommended because it introduces negative incentives to delay votes in order to add features.

This is the establishment of an incremental process, where there wasnâ€™t one before. 

This proposal was passed by a consensus vote.
